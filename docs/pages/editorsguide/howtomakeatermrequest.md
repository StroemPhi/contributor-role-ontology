The following is intended to serve as a guide for anyone who would like to contribute to the CRO project by making new term requests.

# Does the term you are looking for already exist?
First, please look at the current CRO and check whether the term is already there. There are several online browsers that you can use, and it is also possible to use [Protege](http://protege.stanford.edu/).
- BioPortal: [https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CRO](https://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/CRO)  
- OBO Foundry: [http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cro.html](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/cro.html)  
- Ontology Lookup Service: [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cro](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/cro)

# Bundled terms
If you find a description in a publication such as "Sparse eyebrows and eyelashes", note that the description is refering to two separate phenotypic features. The HPO would encode this using two different terms, _Sparse eyebrows_ and _Sparse eyelashes_. The idea is that one HPO term should refer to an "atomic" phenotypic abnormality rather than to a collection of abnormalities observed in an individual patient. Please "debundle" the description and proceed as described above.

# Anatomy of an CRO term
Once you have convinced yourself that the item you need is not already present in the HPO, please provide us with the following information

1. **Label:** What is the name of the term? This should be the name most commonly used by the community.
2. **Synonyms.** If you are aware of synonyms for you term, please include them in your term request.
3. **Definition.** Please try to formulate a definition of your term that will be comprehensible to non-specialists.
4. **References.** Please include a link to a published paper, website or other controlled vocabularly (provide the ID), so that other users of the CRO can find more information about your term.
5. **Parent term.** If possible, please suggest where your new term should be placed within the existing ontology. It is sufficient to write the name(s) of the parent term(s) (i.e., you do not need to tell us the CRO ID, e.g., CRO:0000001)
