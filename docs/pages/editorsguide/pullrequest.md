### Creating a new branch

1. In the terminal, navigate to your local version of the ontology
~~~~
cd repos/contributor-role-ontology/src/ontology
~~~~
_Note: `repos` should be replaced with the folder name on your computer_

2. Type `git status`. You should see:

~~~
On branch [master] [or the name of the branch you are on]
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
~~~

3. If youâ€™re not in the master branch, type: `git checkout master`

4. From the master branch, type: `git pull.` This will update your master branch, and all working branches, with the files that are most current on GitHub, bringing in and merging any changes that were made since you last pulled the repository using the command git pull. You will see something like this:
